# OOPS_IN_C-_Assignments
This repository contains my college OOPS assignment project implementing fundamental object-oriented programming principles including Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. The project demonstrates real-world problem modeling using clean class structures and modular code design.
📘 OOPS Assignments Repository


#📌 Overview

This repository contains 5 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) assignments completed as part of my college coursework. Each assignment consists of multiple questions designed to demonstrate core OOPS concepts through practical implementation.

The repository focuses on understanding and applying fundamental object-oriented principles in a structured and modular way.

🎯 Objectives

The assignments aim to:

Understand the concept of Classes and Objects

Implement Encapsulation

Demonstrate Inheritance

Apply Polymorphism

Use Abstraction

Practice constructor and destructor usage

Improve modular and reusable code design
